            <h3>Introducing the country’s most advanced Access Control System.</h3>
            <article>
                    Employees, staff, clients, deliverymen, couriers... these
                    days, it’s hard to keep track of people on your premises.
                    Security guards do their best to check records and
                    credentials, but there’s always a chance of a security
                    breach. With so many people coming and going, restricted
                    areas can be easily accessed, important documents and
                    material copied and goods and expensive equipment can be
                    stolen. What’s more, guards and people can even be bribed
                    to let an unauthorised person enter.
                    To make matters worse, shift duties add to the confusion.
                    And valuable man-hours are spent on registers, records and
                    overall attendance.
                    The need of the hour is a system that grants access to only
                    authorised personnel. A system that’s intelligent enough to
                    differentiate one employee from the other, add layers of
                    access control and even track and monitor attendance.
                    Ceasefire brings you just a system – the Ceasefire Access
                    Control System, the most advanced in the country.

            <h3>Why Ceasefire Access Control</h3>
            <article>
                <aside class="left"><img src="" /></aside>
                    At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being
                    in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a
                    weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace
                    of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to
                    chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.
                    Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control
                    System - a system that allows you full control.
                    Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality,
                    design and performance, in some of the world’s leading
                    manufacturing facilities, this top-of-the-line range is a system
                    like no other.
                    It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of
                    security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced.
                    From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID
                    restricted areas, the Access Control System guarantees
                    complete protection. In other words, it chooses who can
                    gain access and who can’t, while performing all the duties of
                    a time-keeper, attendance monitor and salary manager. It
                    records, tracks and reports 24x7.

                to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do
                not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the
                main controller.
                Access control can contain several elements. At its most Only in the event that the connection to the main controller is
                basic, is a standalone electric lock, which is unlocked by an unavailable, the readers use their internal database to make
